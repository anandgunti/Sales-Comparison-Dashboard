# Sales Comparison Dashboard: A Comprehensive Analysis of Two Regions

**Objective**: Developed a visually intuitive dashboard using the Sample Superstore dataset to compare sales performance between two regions, aiding upper management in data-driven decision-making.

**Dataset Preparation:** Utilized the 'Group by' function to organize data by Category, Product Name, and Subcategory. Created a hierarchical structure for Location variables (Country, Region, State, City, Postal Code) to enable focused regional analysis.

**Parameterization**: Introduced 'Primary Region' and 'Secondary Region' parameters for flexible regional selection, enhancing user interactivity.

**Key Insights:**

**Sales Trends (2014 Q1 – 2017 Q4):**
**Primary Region (Central)**: Notable upward trends in Furniture and Office Supplies, with Technology catching up post-2017 Q3 dip.
**Secondary Region (South)**: All categories rebounded quickly in early 2017 Q4 post-2017 Q3 slowdown.
**Profit Ratio:**
Secondary Region’s profit ratio is 1.5 times higher than the Primary Region.
Despite a higher customer base, the Primary Region's average sales per order is lower.
Profits by Subcategory:
Primary Region: 40% of subcategories are financially underperforming.
Secondary Region: Only two categories are underperforming, with significant losses in the Tables category.

**Actionable Recommendations:**

Cap discounts in the Tables category to 25% to mitigate losses.
Conduct a micro-analysis of cities within each region to identify and address underperforming products, focusing on optimizing product mix and sales strategies.
